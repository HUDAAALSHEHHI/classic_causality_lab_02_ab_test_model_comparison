üß† Comprehensive Explanation

This experiment demonstrates the process of designing a high-fidelity A/B test to compare the performance of two machine learning models within identical conditions. The approach aims to determine whether the observed improvement in performance is statistically significant or merely due to random variation.
The experiment uses two classification models Logistic Regression and Random Forest trained on the same dataset. By splitting the data equally and applying identical preprocessing steps, the experiment isolates the impact of model architecture alone. The use of t-tests ensures that any difference in accuracy is validated through statistical inference rather than visual comparison.

‚úèÔ∏è Objective

To implement an A/B experiment that quantifies the real effect of replacing one model with another, under the same dataset and evaluation metrics. The objective is to provide a methodologically sound framework for comparing model performance, ensuring that conclusions about superiority are based on causal and statistical evidence.

üìò Results

The experiment revealed that the difference between the two models‚Äô performance was not statistically significant, with a p-value ‚âà 0.57, exceeding the standard 0.05 threshold. This means that the observed improvement in accuracy cannot be attributed to a true causal effect, but rather to random noise or sample variation. However, this outcome underscores the importance of incorporating significance testing in AI research to prevent misinterpretation of results and ensure scientific credibility in model evaluation.

üìó Notes

‚Ä¢	Both models were trained using the same features, ensuring experimental fairness.
‚Ä¢	Randomization was applied during the data split to prevent sampling bias.
‚Ä¢	The t-test was used to determine statistical validity rather than relying on raw accuracy.
‚Ä¢	The experiment can be expanded by increasing dataset size or testing additional metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score.
‚Ä¢	This methodology can be applied across various domains education, healthcare, and finance to assess the true impact of algorithmic changes before deployment.
